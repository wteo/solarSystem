<h2>About</h2>

Created with VueJS. I created this app to learn more about CSS animations and Sass.



<h3>How to navigate?</h3>

While the size and position of the Solar System will adjust in accordance to the size of your screen, for the best experience, I strongly recommend viewing the app in a large, landscape screen.

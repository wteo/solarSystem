<h2>About</h2>

Created with VueJS. I created this app to learn more about CSS animations and Sass.

<h3>How to navigate?</h3>

For aesthetic reasons, especially with the rule of thirds, I intentionally placed the centre position of the Solar System (aka the Sun) one-third from the left of the screen.

While the size and position of the Solar System will adjust in accordance with the size of your screen, for the best experience, I strongly recommend viewing the app in a large, landscape screen.

If you click on any of the planets, Sun or Asteroids, a description box will appear giving you basic details of that selected object

You can close this description box by clicking on the same object or hit the close button on the top-right corner of the box.

<h3>Settings</h3>

Where you want to make some adjustments, click on the settings icon found at the top-left of your screen.

The settings have two main features: 
1. Orbit, which hides / unhides the dashed borders of the planets orbiting the sun. 
2. Animation, which pauses or resumes the animation.
3. 
The app also hides a music visualizer at the bottom of the screen. If this is your first time visiting the website, the music should automatically play in the background. Though, some internet browsers may disable its autoplay feature. 

By hovering your mouse over the bottom screen, you can unhide the music visualizer, which allows you to pause, play or resume music.
